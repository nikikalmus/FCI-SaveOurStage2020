# FCI-SaveOurStage2020
Code used for "Coco's Correlations" for Finest City Improv's Save Our Stage Initiative of Spring 2020. Donate to Finest City Improv (finestcityimprov.com) if you can to keep our theater open while we wait to resume classes and shows until it is safe for our community. 

# What is this GitHub thing?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. If you aren't a coder in any capacity - don't worry, I am just sharing my code for those of you who are interested in learning R or those who know programming languages and want to see what I did with the data.
It's pretty simple! Keep reading my articles in the Private SOS group, and you'll learn more.
